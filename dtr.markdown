## Defining The Relationship

### Expectations?
  * Lucy- Become more familiar with complex Rails routing and more Active Record.
  * Anna- Higher level Rails practice. Work more with testing higher level Rails.
  * Karina- I would like to test JavaScript. More familiar with complex Rails. Time management.

### Availability?
  * Lucy- Might not be ready weekends(during day is a probability).
  * Anna- Leaving at 3 on Tuesday. Weekends are generally free(would like to divvy up work and work individually). Going to a concert Monday afternoon.
  * Karina- Doesn't prefer to stay late during week. Weekends are free.

### Communication?
  * Lucy- Prefers discussing in person, slack, feedback is important.
  * Anna- Would like good commit messages, review code and write comments before merging a pull request. Communicate where everyone is in the morning. Way of asking questions may sound like she's challenging you but it is genuine inquiry.
  * Karina- Review code before merging. Will ask a lot of questions. (probs ignant)

### Strengths?
  * Lucy- Really good at breaking up problems logically but doesn't communicate super well all of the time.
  * Anna- Tends to prioritize well in an attempt to keep the project going on the right path.
  * Karina- TDD.

### Work on?
  * Lucy- Communicating mental process more well.
  * Anna- Patience, not being afraid to admit that she needs to work on something.
  * Karina- Pushing things down the stack, time management, not being afraid to admit something is not clicking.

### Features?
  * Lucy- Twitter OAUTH(any OAUTH in general), stripe
  * Anna- Google Maps
  * Karina- Dream feature-- would LOVE to somehow incorporate a database of upcoming elections that one could vote for.

### Git Workflow?
  Development branch, master is EXCLUSIVELY used for production ready things. Small pull requests into branch.
  Really good commit messages. Reviewing code before merging and commenting, don't merge your own pull request. Slack when you've made a pull request. Double check that all tests are passing before you open a pull request. Write it in your pull request that all tests are passing. (or needs code review because they are not.). Keep commits and branches small.  

### Personal work/communication style?
  Go on walks together, stay hydrated, if stuck-- relocate.
